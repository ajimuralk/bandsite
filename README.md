# Band Site
[Academic Project] - A fictional band's website built in sprints, and used to showcase competency in Flexbox, SASS, BEM, responsive design, and APIs.

<h2>About</h2>

This was an early project for my web development diploma program. My task was to create a responsive, multi-page site that connects to an API in three week-long sprints. Mockups from a UI/UX designer was provided, and I was expected to create the site according to its specifications. 

<h2>Key Learnings</h2>

- Wrote semantic HTML and used the principles of BEM for clear, minimal markup. 
- Became proficient in the CSS layout, Flexbox, SASS preprocessor, and the principles of responsive and mobile-first design. 
- Used Axios for API HTTP requests.
